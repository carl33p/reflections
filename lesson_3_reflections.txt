When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repo to colloborate with other users.  Push and pull from it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual let's you times things accordingly.  Auto pulls would interrupt your development and cause merges before you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork copies a repo on github to your account.  Clone copies a repo from github to your local computer, or on your local computer to another directory on your computer.  Branches just create a new copy of the files in your repo seperate from other branches.
