When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repo to colloborate with other users.  Push and pull from it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual let's you times things accordingly.  Auto pulls would interrupt your development and cause merges before you are ready.
