What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repo, it creates the hidden .got folder.
You need to do it for git to start tracking the repo and make your first commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add files related to your logical change.  Review them before committing.
