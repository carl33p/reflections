What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repo, it creates the hidden .got folder.
You need to do it for git to start tracking the repo and make your first commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add files related to your logical change.  Review them before committing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when you want to make some changes but leave the main branch in tact.  Possibly if working seperatly from the main goal. 
Branches help by creating alternative versions that can be updated in parallel.
